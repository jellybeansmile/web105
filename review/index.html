    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p> <strong>The Outsiders </strong> written by<em> S.E. Hinton.</em> 
        It tells the story of 14-year-old named Ponyboy Curtis and his two older brothers, 
        Soda and Darry. The boys are orphans and struggle to stick together in their 
        lower-class neighborhood, known as the East Side. They and their friends are part 
        of a gang of working class tough street boys called the Greasers.
    </p>
    <p> At the age of 16 years old S.E. Hinton wrote about how revolutionized 
        young adult fiction with its hard-hitting look at the social politics of being a teenager 
        in mid-twentieth century America. It began a trend in the genre of taking a more serious look at the struggles of growing up.

    <h2>About Ponyboy</h2>
    <p> Ponyboy Curtis, the youngest member of the greasers, being the main character of the novel. 
        Ponyboy theorizes on the motivations and personalities 
        of his friends and describes events in a slangy, youthful voice. Though only fourteen years old, he understands the way his social
        group functions and the role each group member plays. He sees that Two-Bit is the wisecracker, Darry the natural leader, and Dally the dangerous hood.
